create virtual cloud networks public facing and private

Use the vcn wizard to create a vcn with internet connectivity

it will create the public and private subnets 

VCN Name: oci-vcn-dev

The default CIDR block should be sufficient for a simple vcn.

VCN IPv4 CIDR block  
	10.0.0.0/16

To support IPv6:
	Enable IPv6 in this VCN
	
	Check: Assign an Oracle-allocated IPv6 /56 GUA prefix to your VCN

DNS:

	Check: Use DNS hostnames in this VCN


For the public and private subnets, use the default CIDR blocks:

Public Subnet: 10.0.0.0/24

Private Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24


After selecting Next, you will see the settings for the VCN, including subnets and gateways:

Gateways:
Internet gateway-oci-vcn-dev	Internet gateway	public subnet-oci-vcn-dev
NAT gateway-oci-vcn-dev			NAT gateway			private subnet-oci-vcn-dev
Service gateway-oci-vcn-dev		Service gateway		private subnet-oci-vcn-dev

Default routing tables will also be created.
