create an object storage bucket for external data that databases will access:

Go to Storage > Object Storage & Archive Storage > Buckets

Create a bucket

Bucket Name: adw_ext_data

You can enable versioning, we are just going to create a simple bucket

Encrypt using Oracle managed keys
Leaves all encryption-related matters to Oracle.
		

After the bucket is created, take a break and create a database.
Then come back to this step and set up the correct access privileges to access the bucket.
